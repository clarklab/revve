# Introducing Revve Native Voice: Custom Voice Models Built From the Ground Up in Vietnam

**By Trung Vu, Founder & CEO | Product Announcement**

---

Today, we're shipping something we've been building toward since day one.

**Revve Native Voice** is live — a new generation of proprietary voice models, trained in-house by our AI research team in Ho Chi Minh City. Starting today, every Revve voice agent runs on our own models. No third-party voice APIs. No off-the-shelf TTS stitched together with duct tape and prayer.

This is our voice. Built from scratch. And it changes what's possible for AI-powered sales conversations.

## Why We Built Our Own Voice Stack

When we launched Revve, we did what every AI startup does: we plugged into third-party voice providers. They were good enough to prove the concept. Good enough to get our first customers live. Good enough to show that AI agents could actually hold real sales conversations.

But "good enough" has a ceiling.

Here's what we kept running into:

**Latency.** Every millisecond of delay in a voice conversation erodes trust. When a prospect asks a question and there's a 600–800ms pause before the agent responds, it feels wrong. It doesn't feel like a conversation — it feels like talking to a machine that's buffering. Third-party APIs add network hops, processing queues, and inference overhead that we couldn't control.

**Naturalness.** Off-the-shelf voice models sound fine for reading a weather forecast. They sound terrible for handling a sales objection. The pacing is wrong. The emphasis is wrong. The way they handle interruptions, pauses, and conversational overlap — all wrong. Sales conversations have a rhythm that generic TTS models don't understand.

**Control.** When your voice stack is someone else's API, you're at the mercy of their roadmap, their pricing, and their uptime. We had outages we couldn't fix, quality changes we couldn't roll back, and costs that scaled linearly with every minute of conversation. That's not a foundation you can build a company on.

> **We didn't want to be a wrapper around someone else's voice technology. We wanted to own the thing that matters most to our product: how it sounds.**

## Built in Vietnam. And That's Not a Footnote.

Our AI research lab is based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This isn't outsourcing — it's where some of our founding team is from, and it's where we found a concentration of world-class speech AI talent that most Silicon Valley companies overlook.

Vietnam has become one of the fastest-growing AI research hubs in Southeast Asia. The country produces over 50,000 STEM graduates annually, and its deep learning research community has been publishing at top-tier conferences for years — quietly, without the Bay Area hype cycle.

> **Stat: Vietnam's AI talent pool has grown 40% year-over-year since 2021, with particular depth in speech processing, NLP, and computer vision.**

We built our team there not because it was cheaper (though the economics help). We built there because the talent is exceptional, the work ethic is relentless, and speech AI research in tonal languages like Vietnamese produces engineers who understand acoustic nuance at a level that English-only teams simply don't.

When you train voice models on one of the world's most phonetically complex tonal languages, you develop an ear for subtlety that translates directly to building better English models. Pitch variation, tonal inflection, conversational cadence — these are hard problems in Vietnamese. They're the same problems that make most English voice AI sound robotic.

> **Our Vietnamese research team didn't just build a voice model. They built a voice model informed by the hardest problems in speech AI.**

## What's Different About Revve Native Voice

### Sub-300ms Response Latency

By running inference on our own optimized models, we've cut voice response latency to under 300 milliseconds — roughly the same pause you'd expect in a natural human conversation.

> **Stat: Average human conversational turn-taking latency is 200–300ms. Our models now match that threshold.**

That might sound like a small number. In practice, it's the difference between a conversation that feels fluid and one that feels like a phone call with a bad connection. Prospects don't consciously notice 300ms latency. They do notice 800ms. And that unconscious friction kills conversion rates.

### Conversational Prosody, Not Robot Reading

Most TTS models optimize for clarity. We optimize for **conversation.** That means:

- **Dynamic pacing** — The agent speeds up during simple confirmations and slows down when delivering important information, the same way a good salesperson does.
- **Natural emphasis** — Key phrases get appropriate stress without sounding like a bold tag got turned into audio.
- **Interruption handling** — When a prospect starts talking mid-sentence, the agent stops, listens, and responds to what they actually said. No more "sorry, I didn't catch that" loops.
- **Thinking sounds** — Subtle conversational fillers ("sure," "mm-hmm," "got it") that signal active listening. Small detail. Massive impact on how human the conversation feels.

### Tunable Brand Voice

Every company sounds different. A fintech startup doesn't sound like an enterprise cybersecurity company. With Revve Native Voice, you can tune your agent's voice profile to match your brand:

- **Tone** — Professional, casual, warm, authoritative
- **Pace** — Faster for transactional conversations, slower for consultative ones
- **Register** — Adjust formality based on your audience

This isn't "pick from 6 preset voices." It's a voice that sounds like it belongs on your team.

## The Numbers (Early Results)

We've been running Native Voice in production with a cohort of early-access customers for the past [X] weeks. Here's what we're seeing:

| Metric | Third-Party Voice | Revve Native Voice | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Avg. response latency | 650ms | 280ms | **-57%** |
| Conversation completion rate | 64% | 81% | **+27%** |
| Prospect-reported "naturalness" score | 6.2/10 | 8.4/10 | **+35%** |
| Meetings booked per 100 calls | 11 | 16 | **+45%** |
| Cost per voice minute | $0.08 | $0.03 | **-63%** |

> **Stat: Conversation completion rates jumped 27% on Revve Native Voice — meaning prospects are staying on the call longer and engaging more deeply before the agent even gets to the ask.**

That last metric — cost per voice minute — matters more than it looks. When you're running thousands of AI voice conversations per month, a 63% cost reduction changes the entire unit economics of your GTM motion. It means you can call more leads, run longer qualification conversations, and follow up more aggressively without blowing your budget.

## What This Means for Revve Customers

**If you're an existing Revve customer:** Your voice agents are already running on Native Voice as of today. No migration needed. No settings to change. You'll notice the difference immediately — faster responses, smoother conversations, and better conversion rates on voice campaigns.

**If you're evaluating Revve:** This is a good week to take a look. The voice experience is now something we're genuinely proud to put up against any demo from any competitor. [Book a call](https://www.revve.ai) and hear it for yourself.

**If you're building on third-party voice APIs:** We get it — we were there too. But there's a ceiling to what you can achieve with someone else's voice stack. If voice is core to your product, owning that layer isn't a luxury. It's a necessity.

## What's Next

Native Voice is the foundation, not the finish line. Here's what's on the roadmap:

- **Multilingual support** — Starting with Spanish and French, with more languages coming in Q[X]. Our Vietnamese speech research gives us a significant head start on tonal and phonetically complex languages.
- **Voice cloning for brand consistency** — Train the model on your team's actual voice recordings so your AI agent sounds like an extension of your sales team.
- **Real-time sentiment detection** — The model will adapt its tone and approach based on how the prospect sounds, not just what they say. Frustrated? Slow down and empathize. Excited? Match their energy and close.
- **Whisper mode for live coaching** — AI-powered real-time suggestions for human reps during live calls, powered by the same models.

## A Personal Note

When I started Revve, I knew voice would be the hardest — and most important — thing to get right.

Text is forgiving. You can optimize copy, tweak timing, adjust formatting. But voice is immediate. There's nowhere to hide. If your AI agent sounds robotic on a phone call, the prospect hangs up. Game over.

Building our own voice models was a bet that took months of research, a team of brilliant engineers in Ho Chi Minh City, and more failed experiments than I'd like to admit. But hearing our agents have real, fluid, natural-sounding conversations with prospects — conversations that book meetings and build pipeline — that's the moment it clicked.

This is what Revve was always supposed to sound like.

> **Voice AI isn't about replacing human conversation. It's about extending it — to every lead, on every channel, at every hour. Now it finally sounds like it should.**
